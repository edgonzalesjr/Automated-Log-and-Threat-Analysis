## Objective

To develop a Python and Bash scripts that automate the process of log analysis, malware analysis, and incident response. These scripts focus on identifying suspicious activities, extracting indicators of compromise (IoC), analyzing system logs for failed login attempts, monitoring user account creation, detecting potential threats, and performing security checks on critical directories and system logs.

### Skills Learned

- Log Analysis & Parsing: Writing scripts to parse and analyze different types of logs (JSON, CSV, Syslog, etc.) and identify suspicious activities.
- Malware Analysis: Processing email files and attachments to detect malicious content by calculating cryptographic hashes and comparing them against known threat intelligence databases.
- Incident Response: Automating incident response procedures, including detecting and blocking suspicious IPs, failed login attempts, and analyzing system logs for potential security threats.
- System Monitoring & Security Checks: Writing scripts to monitor system logs for error messages, failed login attempts, hardware failures, and identifying suspicious user account creation activities.
- Automation of Threat Detection: Automating the process of filtering and analyzing log files for common attack patterns such as SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, and brute-force login attempts.
- Critical Directory Monitoring: Automating monitoring of critical directories for file changes and detecting anomalies based on predefined time periods.

### Tools Used

- Python: For writing scripts to parse logs, extract IoCs, and perform automated analysis on email files, attachments, and system logs.
- Bash: For automating tasks like parsing system logs, monitoring login attempts, and identifying suspicious activities.
- grep and cut commands: Used in Bash for filtering specific log entries based on user-defined parameters.
- find and ls commands: Used in Bash to search for modified files in a critical directory and output relevant details.
- sha256: Used for hashing email attachments to verify their integrity and compare against known malicious hashes.

## Outcome

- Automated Log Analysis: The creation of scripts that efficiently parse and analyze logs to detect and report suspicious activities, including failed login attempts, suspicious URLs, and other indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- Malware Detection: The development of Python scripts to automate the extraction and hashing of email attachments for faster identification of malicious content.
- Enhanced Incident Response: Automating the process of detecting and mitigating threats, such as blocking IP addresses involved in brute-force login attempts.
- Improved Security Monitoring: Implementing automated monitoring scripts to track critical directory changes, failed logins, account creation, and system errors, help to quickly identify and respond to security incidents.
- Efficient Reporting: Generating detailed reports based on the analysis of logs, suspicious activities, and system issues, providing valuable insights.
